How this fulfilled the creative requirements:

1. The first part is a rough recreation of my boyfriend's bedroom, a place I feel at home at
2. The second part is a wooden shack from minecraft, representing the decade and thousands (if not tens of thousands) of hours I have spent playing minecraft, making it feel familiar and homely to me
3. the third room is the meme room, as one of my most common coping mechanisms is making memes out of my unfortunate circumstances, which makes it a lot more bearable.
